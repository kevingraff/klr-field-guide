\begin{abstract}
	This field manual is designed to be easy to carry on your phone or laptop for emergency and routine maintenance. It is not a replacement for the Clymer manaul but rather a different approach to describing the various inner workings and black magic in a modern (hahaha) motorcycle. Think of it as a tips and tricks guide full of experience-based wisdom.
	
	That being said, the authors, contributors and anyone involved in this guide offer no guarentees and hold no liability for anything you do or don't do to your bike that may or may not cause damage to you, your bike, someone else, or someone else's stuff.
	
	Don't sue me I'm a Canadian.
